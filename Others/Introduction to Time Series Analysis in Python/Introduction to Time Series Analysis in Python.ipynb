    "# Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. This course will introduce you to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, you'll learn about several time series models ranging from `autoregressive` and `moving average models` to `cointegration models`. Along the way, you'll learn how to `estimate`, `forecast`, and `simulate` these models using statistical libraries in Python. You'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance."

    "# 1. Correlation and Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter you'll be introduced to the ideas of correlation and autocorrelation for time series. Correlation describes the relationship between two time series and autocorrelation describes the relationship of a time series with its past values."

    "## A \"Thin\" Application of Time Series\n",
    "Google Trends allows users to see how often a term is searched for. We downloaded a file from Google Trends containing the frequency over time for the search word \"diet\", which is pre-loaded in a DataFrame called diet. A first step when analyzing a time series is to visualize the data with a plot. You should be able to clearly see a gradual decrease in searches for \"diet\" throughout the calendar year, hitting a low around the December holidays, followed by a spike in searches around the new year as people make New Year's resolutions to lose weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many time series datasets you will be working with, the index of dates are strings and should be converted to a datetime index before plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "100 XP\n",
    " - Convert the date index to datetime using pd.to_datetime().\n",
    " - Use the .plot() method with slicing to plot data for only 2012.\n",
    " - Plot the entire time series and set the argument grid=True to better see the year-ends."

    "### Merging Time Series With Different Dates\n",
    "Stock and bond markets in the U.S. are closed on different days. For example, although the bond market is closed on Columbus Day (around Oct 12) and Veterans Day (around Nov 11), the stock market is open on those days. One way to see the dates that the stock market is open and the bond market is closed is to convert both indexes of dates into sets and take the difference in sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    " - Convert the dates in the stocks.index and bonds.index into sets.\n",
    " - Take the difference of the stock set minus the bond set to get those dates where the stock market has data but the bond market does not.\n",
    " - Merge the two DataFrames into a new DataFrame, stocks_and_bonds using the .join() method, which has the syntax df1.join(df2).\n",
    " - To get the intersection of dates, use the argument how='inner'.\n"

    "### Correlation of Stocks and Bonds\n",
    "Investors are often interested in the correlation between the returns of two different assets for asset allocation and hedging purposes. In this exercise, you'll try to answer the question of whether stocks are positively or negatively correlated with bonds. Scatter plots are also useful for visualizing the correlation between the two variables.\n",

    "The positive correlation means that when interest rates go down, stock prices go down. For example, during crises like 9/11, investors sold stocks and moved their money to less risky bonds (this is sometimes referred to as a 'flight to quality'). During these periods, stocks drop and interest rates drop as well. Of course, there are times when the opposite relationship holds too."
